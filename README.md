How to Play
---

Score points for each unique, English word with more than two letters submitted
before time expires.  Build words by selecting contiguous letters without
backtracking.  _Spacebar_ selects a letter; _return_ submits words.

The faces of the cube may be turned.  When no letters are selected,
_return_ cycles through faces, and arrow keys turn
selected faces 90Â°.

A word's score is the square of its letter count.
