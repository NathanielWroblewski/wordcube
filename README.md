  - clean-up index/object references in letters model
  - clean-up error messaging in word submission, maybe word.isValid, word.error?

How to Play
---

Score points for each unique, English word with more than two letters submitted
before time expires.  Build words by selecting contiguous letters without
backtracking.  _Spacebar_ selects a letter; _return_ submits words.

TODO:
The faces of the cube may be turned.  When no letters are selected,
_return_ cycles through faces, and arrow keys turn
selected faces 90Â°.

A word's score is the square of its letter count.
